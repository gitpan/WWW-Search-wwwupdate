wwwupdate.pl Version 1.02.


I<wwwupdate.pl> is a simple perl script to aid in keeping WWW::Search
backends updated as well as the core modules (Search.pm, etc.) without
having to manually do so through CPAN or other means. Frankly, CPAN is
not ideal for WWW::Search mainteance because of the frequency of
requiring new individule modules (at least not for the author). I
always end up having to manually copy backends or be aware when a
backend is available and go through the CPAN commands to retrieve. So, I
wrote this to relieve my pain and suffering in keeping my backends up to
date without any effort on my part :)

Essentially, unless there is a NEW backend, one never has to
theoritically ever have to download WWW::Search again since this will
keep it entirely up to date even when there is a new Search.pm.

What I would do is cron this script to run at least once daily or more
depending on how critical it is for you maintain working backends.
Windows users can use taskmanager under NT/Win98 for this or some other
task scheduler. You can also just run it manually from a command line.

current fixed backends see:
